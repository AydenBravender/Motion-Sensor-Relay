# Motion-Sensor-Relay
An Attiny 85 controls a relay connected to household outlets. It activates the plug to turn a lamp or another household application. 
## Things to Note ##

- My relay was inversed so by sending a signal to it to turn on, it would turn off, vice versa
- Be careful around high voltage, so as to not burn down your house :)
